# RISE notifications for Mozilla Firefox

This is a browser extension for receiving RISE notifications for Firefox.
It checks up to 5 RISE addresses at the same time and it supports currently 7 languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Russian).

Usage is straightforward: simply give 1 to 5 RISE addresses you want to follow.

### Installation
Normally, you can find and install extensions from [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/).

Alternatively, you can download the unpackaged extension by cloning this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/VergillR/rise-notifier-browser-extension-firefox`

The unpackaged extension only runs temporarily (you need to add it every time the browser starts up) but it works. To manually add the extension:
1. open Firefox
2. enter "about:debugging" in the URL bar
3. click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. open the extension's directory and select any file inside the extension.

### Notes
This extension only works for Firefox.
